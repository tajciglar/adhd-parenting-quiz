      "school": "[NAME]'s classroom behavior is a study in social intelligence deployed in service of executive avoidance. [HE/SHE/THEY] asks questions at strategic moments, not always because [HE/SHE/THEY] doesn't know the answer, but because a question buys time and shifts attention. [HE/SHE/THEY] volunteers for tasks that involve talking or presenting, because these activate [HIS/HER/THEIR] genuine strengths, and finds reasons to avoid tasks that require sustained written output or careful sequential work. Teachers often describe [NAME] as bright but inconsistent, engaged but avoidant, charming but frustrating. All of these things are true simultaneously, and they all point to the same underlying dynamic.",
      "bedtime": "[NAME] is often at [HIS/HER/THEIR] most genuinely connected at bedtime, the social performance of the day has wound down, the pressure to manage and navigate has eased, and what remains is often a surprisingly open, thoughtful, emotionally honest child who wants to talk, to connect, and to be known. These moments are worth protecting. The child [NAME] is at 9pm, curious, warm, unguarded, is the child [HE/SHE/THEY] is underneath all the cleverness. Make time for that child every day.",
      "morning": "[NAME] is often one of the smoother morning operators in the house, not because the executive demands of the morning are easier for [HIM/HER/THEM], but because [HE/SHE/THEY] has learned to navigate them socially. A well-timed joke, a redirect of your attention, a charming question that shifts the focus of the conversation, [NAME] has a toolkit for managing morning pressure that doesn't involve actually completing the morning routine. You may find yourself laughing at something [HE/SHE/THEY] said and then realizing five minutes later that [HE/SHE/THEY] still hasn't put [HIS/HER/THEIR] shoes on. This is not deliberate manipulation. It is [NAME]'s most reliable coping strategy operating exactly as it was designed to.",
      "afterSchool": "Homework is where [NAME]'s avoidance strategies are most visible and most persistent. The negotiation, the bargaining, the creative reframing of why the homework doesn't need to be done right now, the sudden urgent need to tell you something important just as you sit down together, these are all [NAME]'s executive system doing what it does best. The task feels genuinely hard. The social route around it feels genuinely easy. Until the environment changes to make avoidance less available and support more present, this dynamic will repeat reliably every afternoon."
    },
    "overwhelm": "[NAME]'s overwhelm is one of the least visible on this list, because [HIS/HER/THEIR] primary response to difficulty is social navigation rather than emotional escalation or physical dysregulation. When [NAME] is overwhelmed, [HE/SHE/THEY] talks more, deflects more, jokes more, negotiates more. The performance intensifies. The charm goes up. And underneath it, quietly, [NAME] is at the limit of what [HIS/HER/THEIR] executive system can manage.\nThe moment when this facade breaks, when the social navigation finally fails, when the task cannot be avoided any longer, when the consequence is unavoidable, can be surprisingly raw. [NAME] may cry, shut down, express genuine shame, or become uncharacteristically quiet. This is [HIM/HER/THEM] without the toolkit. And it is a moment that requires enormous gentleness, because underneath all the cleverness is a child who knows, on some level, that [HE/SHE/THEY] keeps finding ways around things [HE/SHE/THEY] should be able to do, and who carries more shame about that than [HE/SHE/THEY] ever lets on.\nIn these moments the most powerful thing you can do is separate the behavior from the child completely. The avoidance is a strategy. It is not [NAME]. And [NAME] needs to hear that clearly, not just once, but consistently, over time, until [HE/SHE/THEY] begins to believe it.",
    "aboutChild": "[NAME] is the child who can talk [HIMSELF/HERSELF/THEMSELVES] out of almost anything. [HE/SHE/THEY] has an answer for every question, a reason for every situation, and a remarkably persuasive way of presenting both that can leave adults genuinely uncertain about what just happened. [HE/SHE/THEY] is charming, genuinely, naturally, effortlessly charming, in a way that makes people want to give [HIM/HER/THEM] the benefit of the doubt even when the evidence suggests they probably shouldn't. [NAME] is not manipulative in a calculated or malicious sense. [HE/SHE/THEY] is doing what [HIS/HER/THEIR] brain does automatically and extremely well, reading the social situation, identifying the path of least resistance, and using language to navigate toward it.\nWhat drives this behavior is not dishonesty of character. It is the intersection of two neurological realities, a genuine struggle with executive function that makes certain tasks feel insurmountable, and a highly developed social intelligence that has learned, quite effectively, to compensate. When a task feels too hard to start, too overwhelming to organize, or too cognitively demanding to sustain, [NAME]'s brain does not shut down. It finds another route. And the route it has found, charm, persuasion, reframing, works often enough to have become [HIS/HER/THEIR] default response. Understanding this changes everything about how you respond to it.",

        "content": "[NAME]'s profile is shaped by two areas where [HIS/HER/THEIR] brain works differently, and understanding both explains the behavior that is most challenging to live with in a way that makes it genuinely easier to respond to. The first is executive function. [NAME]'s brain struggles with the cognitive work of organizing, initiating, and sustaining effort on tasks that feel difficult, boring, or cognitively demanding. This is not laziness, it is a genuine neurological gap in the system that generates the activation energy needed to begin and persist with hard things. When [NAME] encounters a task that triggers this gap, a difficult worksheet, a multi-step project, a demand that exceeds [HIS/HER/THEIR] current executive capacity, the discomfort is real and significant. It is not mild reluctance. It is something closer to genuine cognitive pain. The avoidance that follows is not a choice to be lazy. It is a nervous system protecting itself from an experience it finds genuinely aversive."
      },

        "title": "Hyperactivity",
        "content": "The second is social awareness. [NAME]'s social intelligence is genuinely high, and this is both a strength and, in its current form, a complicating factor. [HE/SHE/THEY] reads people with precision. [HE/SHE/THEY] knows what adults want to hear, what will defuse a situation, what angle will be most persuasive. [HE/SHE/THEY] uses this knowledge fluidly and instinctively in social situations, including situations where the goal is to avoid something [HIS/HER/THEIR] executive system finds too difficult to face. The social intelligence is real. The executive struggle underneath it is equally real. And the charm is, at its core, a coping strategy, one that works in the short term and builds significant problems in the long term if the underlying executive gap is never properly addressed."

    "hiddenSuperpower": "The verbal intelligence, social awareness, and adaptive thinking that [NAME] currently uses to avoid difficult tasks are the same qualities that will one day make [HIM/HER/THEM] exceptional. The ability to read a room, find the right words, adapt to any audience, and think laterally around obstacles is genuinely rare and genuinely valuable. Leaders, negotiators, communicators, entrepreneurs, the qualities [NAME] is already demonstrating at [HIS/HER/THEIR] age are the foundation of extraordinary capability. The goal is not to suppress these qualities. It is to create an environment where [NAME]'s executive struggles are supported enough that [HE/SHE/THEY] no longer needs to rely on charm as a workaround, and can start using these gifts for something bigger.",
    "animalDescription": "The Fox is widely regarded as one of the most intelligent animals in the natural world, not because it is the strongest or the fastest, but because it is the most adaptable. It reads its environment with extraordinary precision, identifies exactly what is needed in any given situation, and finds a way to get there that most other animals would never think of. It doesn't force its way through obstacles. It finds the gap, the angle, the clever route that was always there but invisible to everyone else. This particular Fox is the Clever one, not clever as a compliment, but clever as a defining feature of how [HIS/HER/THEIR] brain operates. [NAME] doesn't just think. [NAME] thinks around things, and that is a quality that will serve [HIM/HER/THEM] extraordinarily well for the rest of [HIS/HER/THEIR] life, once the right environment is found to channel it."

[HE/SHE/THEY] fidgets, shifts, taps, gets up, calls out, not to disrupt, but to regulate. [HIS/HER/THEIR] teacher may describe [HIM/HER/THEM] as disruptive, impulsive, or unable to follow instructions. What is actually happening is a child whose brain requires movement and novelty to stay engaged, trapped in an environment designed for stillness and repetition. [NAME] is not the problem in that classroom. The mismatch between [HIS/HER/THEIR] neurological needs and the environment's demands is the problem.",
      "bedtime": "[NAME]'s brain does not have a natural dimmer switch. As the day winds down for everyone else, [HIS/HER/THEIR] nervous system is still running. Getting [NAME] to sleep requires more than just putting [HIM/HER/THEM] to bed, it requires a deliberate, consistent wind-down sequence that gradually reduces stimulation. Screens, roughhousing, and exciting conversations close to bedtime will significantly delay sleep. A predictable, calm routine, the same every night, is one of the most powerful tools you have for this part of the day.",
      "morning": "Getting [NAME] out of the house in the morning is one of the most reliably challenging parts of your day, and it will be until the right systems are in place. [HE/SHE/THEY] wakes up already in motion, already talking, already interested in seventeen things before [HIS/HER/THEIR] feet hit the floor. Each step of the morning routine is an opportunity for [HIS/HER/THEIR] attention to be captured by something more interesting than the last. Getting dressed requires passing the bookshelf. Brushing teeth requires walking past the bedroom where something interesting is happening. Every transition is a potential detour, not because [NAME] is being difficult, but because [HIS/HER/THEIR] brain treats every new stimulus as equally important and equally worthy of immediate attention.",
      "afterSchool": "If you were hoping the energy would be lower after a full day of school, it often isn't, at least not immediately. [NAME] arrives home like a pressure valve releasing. Everything that was held in, sat on, and suppressed during the school day comes out at once, in noise, in movement, in a torrent of words about everything and nothing. This is not [NAME] being difficult. This is [NAME] finally being somewhere safe enough to be fully [HIMSELF/HERSELF/THEMSELVES]. Give [HIM/HER/THEM] time and space to decompress before asking anything of [HIM/HER/THEM]."
    },
    "overwhelm": "[NAME]'s overwhelm looks different from most children's. It rarely arrives as quiet withdrawal, it arrives as escalation. When [NAME]'s nervous system reaches its limit, the movement gets bigger, the noise gets louder, the behavior gets more dysregulated. What looks like [NAME] \"acting up\" is often actually [NAME] at the edge of what [HIS/HER/THEIR] nervous system can manage. The stimulation has become too much, the demands have piled up, and the only available response is to go faster and louder rather than slower and quieter.\nIn these moments the instinct is often to clamp down, to demand stillness, raise your voice, increase consequences. This will almost always make things worse. What [NAME] needs when escalating is a reduction in demands, an increase in space, and if possible a physical outlet, a run outside, a jumping session, something that lets the nervous system discharge rather than implode. Once the physical release has happened, [NAME] will come back to baseline faster than you might expect. The recovery time for a Flash Hummingbird, when handled well, is remarkably short.",
    "aboutChild": "[NAME] is the child who is everywhere and nowhere at the same time. [HE/SHE/THEY] starts breakfast, remembers something funny, slides off the chair, picks up a toy from the floor, begins building something, hears a noise outside, goes to investigate, and is genuinely surprised ten minutes later when you point out that the cereal is still on the table, untouched and soggy. This is not defiance. This is not a lack of caring. This is a brain and a body that are wired to keep moving, keep seeking, keep starting, and that find it genuinely, neurologically difficult to slow down, land, and finish. [NAME] is not scattered because [HE/SHE/THEY] is lazy or careless. [HE/SHE/THEY] is scattered because [HIS/HER/THEIR] brain is running at a speed that the world around [HIM/HER/THEM] simply wasn't designed to match.\nLiving with [NAME] is exhilarating and exhausting in almost equal measure. [HE/SHE/THEY] brings energy, spontaneity and an infectious aliveness to every room [HE/SHE/THEY] enters. [HE/SHE/THEY] also leaves a trail, of unfinished tasks, lost belongings, interrupted conversations, and half-built creations, that can make daily life feel like an endless game of catch-up. That trail is not [HIS/HER/THEIR] fault. It is the natural byproduct of a brain that is always already on to the next thing.",

The first is attention. [NAME]'s brain has a dopamine regulation system that is constantly seeking novelty and stimulation. The moment a task becomes familiar, repetitive, or unstimulating, [HIS/HER/THEIR] brain begins scanning for something more activating, not as a choice, but as an automatic neurological response. This is why [NAME] can be completely absorbed in something exciting one minute and completely disengaged from something routine the next. The issue is never ability or desire. It is whether the task in front of [HIM/HER/THEM] is generating enough neurological stimulation to hold [HIS/HER/THEIR] brain in place.

This particular Hummingbird is the Flash one, here, gone, already somewhere else before you finished the sentence. Not because it doesn't care about where it just was.

The moment that emotional response arrives, [HIS/HER/THEIR] attention collapses and the task becomes even harder than it already was. [NAME] may cry, refuse, put [HIS/HER/THEIR] head on the desk, or react with anger that seems completely disproportionate. The teacher sees defiance or dysregulation. [NAME] is experiencing something much closer to genuine overwhelm, and needs support, not consequences.",
      "bedtime": "[NAME] replays the day. The thing someone said at lunch. The moment [HE/SHE/THEY] got in trouble. The homework that felt impossible. The friendship that felt uncertain. [HIS/HER/THEIR] brain does not release these moments easily, they sit heavy and vivid long after everyone else has moved on. Bedtime for [NAME] often requires more emotional support than the rest of the day combined. A few minutes of quiet connection, no agenda, no problem-solving, just presence, can make the difference between a settled night and a very long one.",
      "morning": "The wrong cereal. A shirt that feels slightly uncomfortable. A sibling who said something thoughtless. A permission slip that can't be found. Any one of these alone would be manageable, but for [NAME], by 7:30am the emotional load is already approaching full. Each small frustration adds to the last. When you ask [HIM/HER/THEM] to hurry up and [HE/SHE/THEY] still can't find the permission slip, the mug overflows. What looks from the outside like a meltdown about a piece of paper is actually the accumulated weight of an already overwhelming morning meeting one demand too many. [NAME] is not being dramatic. [HE/SHE/THEY] is at capacity, and capacity was reached before breakfast was finished.",
      "afterSchool": "[NAME] holds it together at school, running on willpower, social pressure, and the constant effort of managing [HIMSELF/HERSELF/THEMSELVES] in a demanding environment. When [HE/SHE/THEY] walks through your front door, that effort ends and everything that was held in releases at once. This is known as afterschool restraint collapse, and it is one of the most reliable features of [NAME]'s day. It is exhausting for everyone. It is also, in its own way, a sign of trust. [NAME] falls apart with you because you are the safest person in [HIS/HER/THEIR] world. That is not nothing."
    },
    "overwhelm": "[NAME]'s overwhelm arrives fast and takes over completely. It may look like a meltdown, a flat refusal, tears that seem wildly out of proportion, or an explosion of anger that appears to come from nowhere. What is happening underneath is a nervous system that has been flooded, logic is temporarily offline and [NAME] genuinely cannot access reason, perspective, or calm until the flood begins to recede. The window between trigger and full overwhelm is very short. The window between full overwhelm and return to baseline is much longer than it looks like it should be.\nTrying to reason, discipline, or problem-solve during this moment will make it worse, not because [NAME] is being stubborn, but because the part of [HIS/HER/THEIR] brain that can receive and process that input is temporarily unavailable. What [NAME] needs in these moments is a regulated adult nearby, minimal language, no new demands, and time. The conversation, the learning, the repair, the connection, can only happen after the storm has passed. And it should always happen. Coming back together after a hard moment is one of the most powerful things you can do for [NAME]'s long term emotional development.",
    "aboutChild": "[NAME] is a child of enormous inner weather. [HE/SHE/THEY] can be laughing and connected one moment and completely undone the next, not because [HE/SHE/THEY] is dramatic or manipulative, but because [HIS/HER/THEIR] emotional experience is genuinely more intense than most people will ever fully understand. When [NAME] faces a task that feels too big, [HIS/HER/THEIR] brain doesn't just feel frustrated, it registers a threat. When something goes wrong socially, it doesn't just feel bad, it feels catastrophic. And when something is wonderful, it is the most wonderful thing that has ever happened to anyone, ever. [NAME] lives at full emotional volume, in every direction, all the time.\nWhat makes this particularly complex is that [NAME] also struggles to stay mentally present. The combination of emotional intensity and inattention means that when feelings arrive, and they arrive fast, [HIS/HER/THEIR] already loosely anchored attention is completely swept away. There is nothing left for logic, for reasoning, for perspective. The feeling takes the whole room. This is not a behaviour problem. This is a brain that feels everything at once and hasn't yet developed the neurological tools to carry it all, and it needs your understanding far more than it needs your correction.",

        "content": "[NAME]'s profile is shaped by two areas where [HIS/HER/THEIR] brain works differently, and understanding both of them changes everything about how you see [HIS/HER/THEIR] behavior. The first is attention. [NAME]'s brain struggles to stay anchored in the present moment under ordinary circumstances, but when emotions are involved, that struggle becomes significantly more acute. The prefrontal cortex, which manages both attention and emotional regulation, is the area most affected in [NAME]'s brain. When an emotion is triggered, frustration, disappointment, excitement, shame, the emotional response floods the prefrontal cortex and attention collapses entirely. This is why [NAME] can seem to be managing reasonably well and then, after one difficult moment, become completely unreachable. The emotion didn't cause a distraction. It caused a neurological shutdown of the very system [NAME] needs to stay present, think clearly, and regulate [HIMSELF/HERSELF/THEMSELVES]."

        "title": "Hyperactivity",
        "content": "The second is emotional regulation. [NAME]'s emotional responses arrive faster and hit harder than [HIS/HER/THEIR] logical brain can manage. Research shows that children with this profile can experience emotions with an intensity two to three times greater than their peers, and take significantly longer to return to baseline once dysregulated. There is very little gap between feeling and reaction. By the time [NAME] is aware of the emotion, it has already taken over. This is not a choice and it is not a character flaw. It is a neurological pattern, one that responds to consistency, co-regulation, and time, not to punishment or reasoning in the heat of the moment."

[NAME] loves fiercely, creates passionately, and connects with others at a depth that most adults spend a lifetime trying to reach. [HE/SHE/THEY] will be the first to notice when someone in the room is quietly sad. The first to stand up for someone being treated unfairly. The first to pour [HIS/HER/THEIR] whole heart into something [HE/SHE/THEY] believes in, a drawing, a friendship, a cause, an idea. [NAME]'s feelings are not the problem. They are [HIS/HER/THEIR] greatest strength, waiting for the right environment to be channeled rather than contained.",
    "animalDescription": "The Tiger is one of the most powerful and capable animals on earth, and also one of the most misunderstood. It does not move in packs or perform for an audience. It carries its strength quietly, privately, and entirely on its own terms. When the Tiger is calm, it is breathtaking, focused, graceful, deeply present. When the Tiger is overwhelmed, everything changes. The response is immediate, total, and impossible to ignore. This particular Tiger is the Fierce one, not fierce because it wants to frighten anyone, but because everything it feels, it feels completely. There is no halfway with this Tiger. There is only all of it, all at once."
