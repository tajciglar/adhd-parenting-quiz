      "school": "[NAME]'s classroom behavior is a study in social intelligence deployed in service of executive avoidance. [HE/SHE/THEY] asks questions at strategic moments, not always because [HE/SHE/THEY] doesn't know the answer, but because a question buys time and shifts attention. [HE/SHE/THEY] volunteers for tasks that involve talking or presenting, because these activate [HIS/HER/THEIR] genuine strengths, and finds reasons to avoid tasks that require sustained written output or careful sequential work. Teachers often describe [NAME] as bright but inconsistent, engaged but avoidant, charming but frustrating. All of these things are true simultaneously, and they all point to the same underlying dynamic.",
      "bedtime": "[NAME] is often at [HIS/HER/THEIR] most genuinely connected at bedtime, the social performance of the day has wound down, the pressure to manage and navigate has eased, and what remains is often a surprisingly open, thoughtful, emotionally honest child who wants to talk, to connect, and to be known. These moments are worth protecting. The child [NAME] is at 9pm, curious, warm, unguarded, is the child [HE/SHE/THEY] is underneath all the cleverness. Make time for that child every day.",
      "morning": "[NAME] is often one of the smoother morning operators in the house, not because the executive demands of the morning are easier for [HIM/HER/THEM], but because [HE/SHE/THEY] has learned to navigate them socially. A well-timed joke, a redirect of your attention, a charming question that shifts the focus of the conversation, [NAME] has a toolkit for managing morning pressure that doesn't involve actually completing the morning routine. You may find yourself laughing at something [HE/SHE/THEY] said and then realizing five minutes later that [HE/SHE/THEY] still hasn't put [HIS/HER/THEIR] shoes on. This is not deliberate manipulation. It is [NAME]'s most reliable coping strategy operating exactly as it was designed to.",
      "afterSchool": "Homework is where [NAME]'s avoidance strategies are most visible and most persistent. The negotiation, the bargaining, the creative reframing of why the homework doesn't need to be done right now, the sudden urgent need to tell you something important just as you sit down together, these are all [NAME]'s executive system doing what it does best. The task feels genuinely hard. The social route around it feels genuinely easy. Until the environment changes to make avoidance less available and support more present, this dynamic will repeat reliably every afternoon."
    },
    "overwhelm": "[NAME]'s overwhelm is one of the least visible on this list, because [HIS/HER/THEIR] primary response to difficulty is social navigation rather than emotional escalation or physical dysregulation. When [NAME] is overwhelmed, [HE/SHE/THEY] talks more, deflects more, jokes more, negotiates more. The performance intensifies. The charm goes up. And underneath it, quietly, [NAME] is at the limit of what [HIS/HER/THEIR] executive system can manage.\nThe moment when this facade breaks, when the social navigation finally fails, when the task cannot be avoided any longer, when the consequence is unavoidable, can be surprisingly raw. [NAME] may cry, shut down, express genuine shame, or become uncharacteristically quiet. This is [HIM/HER/THEM] without the toolkit. And it is a moment that requires enormous gentleness, because underneath all the cleverness is a child who knows, on some level, that [HE/SHE/THEY] keeps finding ways around things [HE/SHE/THEY] should be able to do, and who carries more shame about that than [HE/SHE/THEY] ever lets on.\nIn these moments the most powerful thing you can do is separate the behavior from the child completely. The avoidance is a strategy. It is not [NAME]. And [NAME] needs to hear that clearly, not just once, but consistently, over time, until [HE/SHE/THEY] begins to believe it.",
    "aboutChild": "[NAME] is the child who can talk [HIMSELF/HERSELF/THEMSELVES] out of almost anything. [HE/SHE/THEY] has an answer for every question, a reason for every situation, and a remarkably persuasive way of presenting both that can leave adults genuinely uncertain about what just happened. [HE/SHE/THEY] is charming, genuinely, naturally, effortlessly charming, in a way that makes people want to give [HIM/HER/THEM] the benefit of the doubt even when the evidence suggests they probably shouldn't. [NAME] is not manipulative in a calculated or malicious sense. [HE/SHE/THEY] is doing what [HIS/HER/THEIR] brain does automatically and extremely well, reading the social situation, identifying the path of least resistance, and using language to navigate toward it.\nWhat drives this behavior is not dishonesty of character. It is the intersection of two neurological realities, a genuine struggle with executive function that makes certain tasks feel insurmountable, and a highly developed social intelligence that has learned, quite effectively, to compensate. When a task feels too hard to start, too overwhelming to organize, or too cognitively demanding to sustain, [NAME]'s brain does not shut down. It finds another route. And the route it has found, charm, persuasion, reframing, works often enough to have become [HIS/HER/THEIR] default response. Understanding this changes everything about how you respond to it.",

        "content": "[NAME]'s brain struggles with the cognitive work of organizing, initiating, and sustaining effort on tasks that feel difficult, boring, or cognitively demanding. This is not laziness, it is a genuine neurological gap in the system that generates the activation energy needed to begin and persist with hard things. When [NAME] encounters a task that triggers this gap, a difficult worksheet, a multi-step project, a demand that exceeds [HIS/HER/THEIR] current executive capacity, the discomfort is real and significant. It is not mild reluctance. It is something closer to genuine cognitive pain. The avoidance that follows is not a choice to be lazy. It is a nervous system protecting itself from an experience it finds genuinely aversive."

[HE/SHE/THEY] knows what adults want to hear, what will defuse a situation, what angle will be most persuasive. [HE/SHE/THEY] uses this knowledge fluidly and instinctively in social situations, including situations where the goal is to avoid something [HIS/HER/THEIR] executive system finds too difficult to face. The social intelligence is real. The executive struggle underneath it is equally real. And the charm is, at its core, a coping strategy, one that works in the short term and builds significant problems in the long term if the underlying executive gap is never properly addressed."

    "hiddenSuperpower": "The verbal intelligence, social awareness, and adaptive thinking that [NAME] currently uses to avoid difficult tasks are the same qualities that will one day make [HIM/HER/THEM] exceptional. The ability to read a room, find the right words, adapt to any audience, and think laterally around obstacles is genuinely rare and genuinely valuable. Leaders, negotiators, communicators, entrepreneurs, the qualities [NAME] is already demonstrating at [HIS/HER/THEIR] age are the foundation of extraordinary capability. The goal is not to suppress these qualities. It is to create an environment where [NAME]'s executive struggles are supported enough that [HE/SHE/THEY] no longer needs to rely on charm as a workaround, and can start using these gifts for something bigger.",
    "animalDescription": "The Fox is widely regarded as one of the most intelligent animals in the natural world, not because it is the strongest or the fastest, but because it is the most adaptable. It reads its environment with extraordinary precision, identifies exactly what is needed in any given situation, and finds a way to get there that most other animals would never think of. It doesn't force its way through obstacles. It finds the gap, the angle, the clever route that was always there but invisible to everyone else. This particular Fox is the Clever one, not clever as a compliment, but clever as a defining feature of how [HIS/HER/THEIR] brain operates. [NAME] doesn't just think. [NAME] thinks around things, and that is a quality that will serve [HIM/HER/THEM] extraordinarily well for the rest of [HIS/HER/THEIR] life, once the right environment is found to channel it."

[HE/SHE/THEY] fidgets, shifts, taps, gets up, calls out, not to disrupt, but to regulate. [HIS/HER/THEIR] teacher may describe [HIM/HER/THEM] as disruptive, impulsive, or unable to follow instructions. What is actually happening is a child whose brain requires movement and novelty to stay engaged, trapped in an environment designed for stillness and repetition. [NAME] is not the problem in that classroom. The mismatch between [HIS/HER/THEIR] neurological needs and the environment's demands is the problem.",
      "bedtime": "[NAME]'s brain does not have a natural dimmer switch. As the day winds down for everyone else, [HIS/HER/THEIR] nervous system is still running. Getting [NAME] to sleep requires more than just putting [HIM/HER/THEM] to bed, it requires a deliberate, consistent wind-down sequence that gradually reduces stimulation. Screens, roughhousing, and exciting conversations close to bedtime will significantly delay sleep. A predictable, calm routine, the same every night, is one of the most powerful tools you have for this part of the day.",
      "morning": "Getting [NAME] out of the house in the morning is one of the most reliably challenging parts of your day, and it will be until the right systems are in place. [HE/SHE/THEY] wakes up already in motion, already talking, already interested in seventeen things before [HIS/HER/THEIR] feet hit the floor. Each step of the morning routine is an opportunity for [HIS/HER/THEIR] attention to be captured by something more interesting than the last. Getting dressed requires passing the bookshelf. Brushing teeth requires walking past the bedroom where something interesting is happening. Every transition is a potential detour, not because [NAME] is being difficult, but because [HIS/HER/THEIR] brain treats every new stimulus as equally important and equally worthy of immediate attention.",
      "afterSchool": "If you were hoping the energy would be lower after a full day of school, it often isn't, at least not immediately. [NAME] arrives home like a pressure valve releasing. Everything that was held in, sat on, and suppressed during the school day comes out at once, in noise, in movement, in a torrent of words about everything and nothing. This is not [NAME] being difficult. This is [NAME] finally being somewhere safe enough to be fully [HIMSELF/HERSELF/THEMSELVES]. Give [HIM/HER/THEM] time and space to decompress before asking anything of [HIM/HER/THEM]."
    },
    "overwhelm": "[NAME]'s overwhelm looks different from most children's. It rarely arrives as quiet withdrawal, it arrives as escalation. When [NAME]'s nervous system reaches its limit, the movement gets bigger, the noise gets louder, the behavior gets more dysregulated. What looks like [NAME] \"acting up\" is often actually [NAME] at the edge of what [HIS/HER/THEIR] nervous system can manage. The stimulation has become too much, the demands have piled up, and the only available response is to go faster and louder rather than slower and quieter.\nIn these moments the instinct is often to clamp down, to demand stillness, raise your voice, increase consequences. This will almost always make things worse. What [NAME] needs when escalating is a reduction in demands, an increase in space, and if possible a physical outlet, a run outside, a jumping session, something that lets the nervous system discharge rather than implode. Once the physical release has happened, [NAME] will come back to baseline faster than you might expect. The recovery time for a Flash Hummingbird, when handled well, is remarkably short.",
    "aboutChild": "[NAME] is the child who is everywhere and nowhere at the same time. [HE/SHE/THEY] starts breakfast, remembers something funny, slides off the chair, picks up a toy from the floor, begins building something, hears a noise outside, goes to investigate, and is genuinely surprised ten minutes later when you point out that the cereal is still on the table, untouched and soggy. This is not defiance. This is not a lack of caring. This is a brain and a body that are wired to keep moving, keep seeking, keep starting, and that find it genuinely, neurologically difficult to slow down, land, and finish. [NAME] is not scattered because [HE/SHE/THEY] is lazy or careless. [HE/SHE/THEY] is scattered because [HIS/HER/THEIR] brain is running at a speed that the world around [HIM/HER/THEM] simply wasn't designed to match.\nLiving with [NAME] is exhilarating and exhausting in almost equal measure. [HE/SHE/THEY] brings energy, spontaneity and an infectious aliveness to every room [HE/SHE/THEY] enters. [HE/SHE/THEY] also leaves a trail, of unfinished tasks, lost belongings, interrupted conversations, and half-built creations, that can make daily life feel like an endless game of catch-up. That trail is not [HIS/HER/THEIR] fault. It is the natural byproduct of a brain that is always already on to the next thing.",

This is why [NAME] can be completely absorbed in something exciting one minute and completely disengaged from something routine the next. The issue is never ability or desire. It is whether the task in front of [HIM/HER/THEM] is generating enough neurological stimulation to hold [HIS/HER/THEIR] brain in place.

[HE/SHE/THEY] looks at it and feels an immediate wave of something that sits between dread and panic, not because [HE/SHE/THEY] can't do the work, but because [HIS/HER/THEIR] brain has registered this task as threatening. The moment that emotional response arrives, [HIS/HER/THEIR] attention collapses and the task becomes even harder than it already was. [NAME] may cry, refuse, put [HIS/HER/THEIR] head on the desk, or react with anger that seems completely disproportionate. The teacher sees defiance or dysregulation. [NAME] is experiencing something much closer to genuine overwhelm, and needs support, not consequences.",
      "bedtime": "[NAME] replays the day. The thing someone said at lunch. The moment [HE/SHE/THEY] got in trouble. The homework that felt impossible. The friendship that felt uncertain. [HIS/HER/THEIR] brain does not release these moments easily, they sit heavy and vivid long after everyone else has moved on. Bedtime for [NAME] often requires more emotional support than the rest of the day combined. A few minutes of quiet connection, no agenda, no problem-solving, just presence, can make the difference between a settled night and a very long one.",

Any one of these alone would be manageable, but for [NAME], by 7:30am the emotional load is already approaching full. Each small frustration adds to the last. When you ask [HIM/HER/THEM] to hurry up and [HE/SHE/THEY] still can't find the permission slip, the mug overflows. What looks from the outside like a meltdown about a piece of paper is actually the accumulated weight of an already overwhelming morning meeting one demand too many. [NAME] is not being dramatic. [HE/SHE/THEY] is at capacity, and capacity was reached before breakfast was finished.",
      "afterSchool": "[NAME] holds it together at school, running on willpower, social pressure, and the constant effort of managing [HIMSELF/HERSELF/THEMSELVES] in a demanding environment. When [HE/SHE/THEY] walks through your front door, that effort ends and everything that was held in releases at once. This is known as afterschool restraint collapse, and it is one of the most reliable features of [NAME]'s day. It is exhausting for everyone. It is also, in its own way, a sign of trust. [NAME] falls apart with you because you are the safest person in [HIS/HER/THEIR] world. That is not nothing."

    "overwhelm": "[NAME]'s overwhelm arrives fast and takes over completely. It may look like a meltdown, a flat refusal, tears that seem wildly out of proportion, or an explosion of anger that appears to come from nowhere. What is happening underneath is a nervous system that has been flooded, logic is temporarily offline and [NAME] genuinely cannot access reason, perspective, or calm until the flood begins to recede. The window between trigger and full overwhelm is very short. The window between full overwhelm and return to baseline is much longer than it looks like it should be.\nTrying to reason, discipline, or problem-solve during this moment will make it worse, not because [NAME] is being stubborn, but because the part of [HIS/HER/THEIR] brain that can receive and process that input is temporarily unavailable. What [NAME] needs in these moments is a regulated adult nearby, minimal language, no new demands, and time. The conversation, the learning, the repair, the connection, can only happen after the storm has passed. And it should always happen. Coming back together after a hard moment is one of the most powerful things you can do for [NAME]'s long term emotional development.",

[HE/SHE/THEY] can be laughing and connected one moment and completely undone the next, not because [HE/SHE/THEY] is dramatic or manipulative, but because [HIS/HER/THEIR] emotional experience is genuinely more intense than most people will ever fully understand. When [NAME] faces a task that feels too big, [HIS/HER/THEIR] brain doesn't just feel frustrated, it registers a threat. When something goes wrong socially, it doesn't just feel bad, it feels catastrophic. And when something is wonderful, it is the most wonderful thing that has ever happened to anyone, ever. [NAME] lives at full emotional volume, in every direction, all the time.\nWhat makes this particularly complex is that [NAME] also struggles to stay mentally present. The combination of emotional intensity and inattention means that when feelings arrive, and they arrive fast, [HIS/HER/THEIR] already loosely anchored attention is completely swept away. There is nothing left for logic, for reasoning, for perspective. The feeling takes the whole room. This is not a behaviour problem. This is a brain that feels everything at once and hasn't yet developed the neurological tools to carry it all, and it needs your understanding far more than it needs your correction.",

[NAME] is not slow. [NAME] moved constantly for twenty minutes. The movement just didn't connect to the goal. What helps: give one instruction at a time (\"shoes on\" then wait, then \"bag by the door\"). A visual checklist on the wall with pictures or words keeps the sequence visible. Your presence during the routine helps anchor the steps. Over time, you can gradually step back as the habit builds.",
      "school": "[NAME]'s teacher sees a child who cannot stay in [HIS/HER/THEIR] seat, struggles to begin assignments without direct one-on-one prompting, leaves tasks unfinished, loses materials regularly, and seems to have no awareness of time passing. All of this is accurate — and all of it is executive function, not attitude. The classroom environment, which assumes a working internal organisational system, is one of the most demanding environments for [NAME]. Every request the classroom makes — sit, plan, begin, sequence, finish, transition — is a direct request on the system that is [NAME]'s greatest area of neurological difference. [NAME] is not failing to try. [NAME] is trying enormously hard in an environment that requires the one thing [HIS/HER/THEIR] brain finds hardest. What helps: ask [NAME]'s teacher to provide a clear first step when giving assignments (\"Start by writing your name and reading question one\"), allow movement breaks, and use a visual timer for transitions.",
      "afterSchool": "Free time for [NAME] is genuinely free — unstructured, unplanned, and driven entirely by whatever presents itself first. This can look like chaos to an observer. To [NAME] it feels like relief. The absence of executive demands is genuinely restorative. However, without some gentle structure, even free time can become frustrating — [NAME] may cycle through many activities without settling, not because [HE/SHE/THEY] is bored but because [HIS/HER/THEIR] brain finds it hard to self-direct even in play. A loose framework — two or three options to choose from rather than infinite open space — often helps more than it constrains. What helps: offer a simple choice (\"Do you want to ride your bike or build with Lego?\") rather than asking \"What do you want to do?\" Open-ended questions require the executive planning that is [NAME]'s hardest skill.",
      "bedtime": "The transition to bed is a significant executive challenge for [NAME]. It requires [HIM/HER/THEM] to stop a current activity, follow a sequence of steps, and arrive at sleep — all of which demand exactly the skills [HIS/HER/THEIR] brain finds hardest. A visual routine — pictures or a checklist of the bedtime steps in order — is a genuine cognitive support that removes the working memory load from a brain that is already tired and running low on regulatory capacity. A sample structure: physical wind-down 30 minutes before bed, followed by bath or shower, then 20 minutes of quiet time (reading together or calm music, no screens), then lights out. Consistency matters more than perfection."

    "overwhelm": "[NAME]'s overwhelm shows up physically before anything else. When the executive demands of a situation exceed what [HIS/HER/THEIR] brain can manage — too many steps, too much to hold, too much expected without enough support — the response is escalating physical dysregulation. The movement gets bigger. The behaviour gets more erratic. The ability to follow even simple instructions fades. This is not defiance. It is a nervous system that has reached its organisational ceiling and is discharging the overload through the only channel reliably available to it — physical movement.\nIn these moments, adding more verbal instruction will not help. [NAME]'s working memory is already full. More words are simply more load on a system that is already overwhelmed. What helps is reducing demands to zero, providing a physical outlet, and waiting. Once [HIS/HER/THEIR] nervous system has discharged and returned to baseline, [NAME] will be genuinely ready to try again — and will often do so with complete willingness, as if the previous storm never happened. That reset is real. Trust it.\nIf you find this pattern happening daily, it may help to build in more physical release earlier in the day — before the demands stack up. A 15-minute burst of intense movement (running, trampolining, climbing) before homework or transitions can lower the baseline enough to prevent the overflow.",

It is that the internal system that takes energy and points it in a useful direction — the system that creates plans, sequences steps, and tracks progress toward a goal — is not yet working the way it will one day. [NAME] has the engine of a racing car and the steering is still developing. The speed is real. The power is real. The destination is genuinely unclear.\nThis can be deeply frustrating for the adults around [NAME] — who see all that capability and energy and cannot understand why it doesn't seem to translate into anything finished, organised, or on time. It is equally frustrating for [NAME], who genuinely wants to do well, genuinely intends to complete things, and genuinely cannot understand why the gap between intention and execution is so consistently wide.

This is not venting for the sake of it. This is [NAME]'s emotional processing system doing the work it needs to do to move forward. The most helpful response is to listen fully, validate genuinely, and resist the urge to minimise or reframe until [NAME] has finished. A practical approach: give [NAME] 15 minutes of your undivided listening when [HE/SHE/THEY] gets home.

[HE/SHE/THEY] is reacting to today plus every time this has happened before, carried forward with full emotional intensity.\nIn these moments [NAME] needs one thing above all else before anything else is possible — to be heard. Not agreed with. Not validated in every detail. Simply heard. An adult who listens fully, acknowledges genuinely, and resists the urge to immediately correct, reframe, or minimise will find that [NAME]'s overwhelm de-escalates faster than almost any other intervention. The argument, the explanation, the teaching moment — all of these are available and valuable, but only after [NAME] has felt genuinely heard. Before that moment, no amount of reasoning will reach [HIM/HER/THEM]. After it, [NAME] is often surprisingly open, reflective, and willing to consider other perspectives.\nIf this pattern is happening frequently, it can help to build a \"fairness journal\" with [NAME] — a notebook where [HE/SHE/THEY] writes or draws what felt unfair that day.

It remembers every kindness and every wrong. It remembers the path taken years ago and the face of someone it hasn't seen in a decade. It carries its history with it completely — every experience, every interaction, every moment of connection stored with extraordinary fidelity. The Elephant also lives in community more deeply than almost any other animal — its social bonds are fierce, its loyalty absolute, its grief when those bonds are broken genuinely profound. This particular Elephant is the Justice one — the one for whom fairness is not a preference but a principle, and for whom the world's failure to operate according to that principle is not an inconvenience but a genuine, daily source of pain."

None of this is designed to be disruptive. [NAME]'s brain woke up full — full of thoughts, full of energy, full of things that need to be shared — and the morning is the first available outlet. The challenge is that the morning also has a schedule, and [NAME]'s social momentum and the morning's practical demands are almost always in direct conflict. What helps: give [NAME] a specific \"talk time\" during breakfast (\"Tell me your best thing while we eat\") and then a clear transition signal (\"Now it's get-ready time. We'll talk more in the car\"). This channels the social energy rather than fighting it.",
      "school": "The classroom is where [NAME]'s social profile creates the most consistent difficulty. [HE/SHE/THEY] calls out answers before being asked. [HE/SHE/THEY] interrupts the teacher mid-sentence — not defiantly, but because the thought arrived and the thought felt urgent. [HE/SHE/THEY] turns to talk to a classmate at precisely the moment the classmate is trying to focus. In group work [HE/SHE/THEY] leads with energy — not to exclude others, but because [HIS/HER/THEIR] ideas are coming faster than the group can receive them. Teachers see disruption. [NAME] sees connection. The mismatch between these two realities is one of the most painful features of [NAME]'s school experience. What helps: a \"thought parking lot\" — a small notebook where [NAME] jots ideas to share later instead of blurting them. This honours the thought without disrupting the class.\nSocially, [NAME] often finds that [HIS/HER/THEIR] peer relationships are warm but uneven. [HE/SHE/THEY] is liked — [HIS/HER/THEIR] energy and enthusiasm are genuinely appealing — but [HE/SHE/THEY] can also be found tiring by children who need a slower, quieter pace. [NAME] may cycle through friendships more quickly than most, not because [HE/SHE/THEY] is unkind but because the sustained regulation required to maintain reciprocal friendships over time is one of [HIS/HER/THEIR] most significant challenges. What helps: coach [NAME] on one specific social skill at a time. This week's skill might be \"ask one question, then wait for the full answer.\" Practise it at home, role-play it, celebrate when it happens. Small, specific, repeated.",

Where possible, give [HIM/HER/THEM] this time before anything else is asked. The debrief is not a distraction from the afternoon.

A structured wind-down that gradually reduces social stimulation — moving from conversation to reading to quiet — works better than an abrupt transition to silence, which [NAME]'s brain will resist. A brief, contained final conversation — two minutes, then lights out, no extensions — gives [NAME]'s social brain the closing it needs without opening the door to another hour of talking. What helps: set a timer for the final conversation. When it ends, say \"Save the rest for tomorrow morning. I want to hear it then.\" This gives [NAME] permission to stop without feeling unheard."

    "overwhelm": "[NAME]'s overwhelm is social at its core — it arrives when connection goes wrong, when [HE/SHE/THEY] has been rejected, excluded, or told one too many times that [HE/SHE/THEY] is too much. The response is rarely quiet. [NAME]'s distress, like [HIS/HER/THEIR] joy, is expressed externally — in tears, in escalating bids for connection, in increased volume and increased urgency that can look like deliberate disruption but is actually a nervous system in genuine pain.\nWhat [NAME] needs in these moments is connection — not distance. The instinct to withdraw [HIM/HER/THEM] from social situations when [HIS/HER/THEIR] behaviour escalates can make things significantly worse, because removal from connection is the very thing [NAME]'s nervous system experiences as most threatening. A calm, close, regulated adult who offers genuine presence — not to talk, not to problem-solve, just to be there — will de-escalate [NAME] faster than almost any other intervention. Once [HIS/HER/THEIR] nervous system has felt genuinely received, [NAME] will come back to baseline with remarkable speed. The need for connection that drives the overwhelm is the same need that, when met, resolves it.\nIf social rejection is a recurring trigger, it helps to build a \"social replay\" routine with [NAME]. After a difficult interaction, walk through it together: \"What happened? What did you want to happen? What could you try next time?\" This builds the self-monitoring skills [NAME]'s brain is still developing, without shame.",

[HE/SHE/THEY] genuinely, deeply, fundamentally needs other people — not as a preference but as a neurological requirement. Connection is not something [NAME] enjoys. It is something [NAME] runs on. The energy, the ideas, the joy that [HE/SHE/THEY] brings to every social interaction is entirely real — and it is also entirely unregulated. [NAME] interrupts not because [HE/SHE/THEY] doesn't care about the person speaking, but because the thought that just arrived feels so urgent, so alive, so certain to vanish if not spoken immediately, that waiting feels genuinely neurologically impossible. The interruption is not rudeness. It is the urgency of a brain that knows its ideas are fleeting and has learned, through experience, that the only way to keep them is to say them right now.\nThis creates a painful paradox at the heart of [NAME]'s social life. The thing [NAME] wants most — genuine, sustained connection with peers — is made harder by the very quality that drives [HIS/HER/THEIR] desire for it. [HE/SHE/THEY] comes on with full energy, full warmth, full enthusiasm. [HE/SHE/THEY] can dominate conversations without meaning to. [HE/SHE/THEY] misses the moment when the other person has had enough — not because [HE/SHE/THEY] doesn't care, but because [HIS/HER/THEIR] social accelerator is fully engaged and [HIS/HER/THEIR] brakes are still developing.

But underneath those spines is one of the softest, most gentle animals you will ever encounter. The spines are not aggression. They are protection — a nervous system's response to a world that arrives too fast, too loud, and too sharp. When the Hedgehog feels safe — truly safe — it uncurls, shows its belly, and is warm, curious, and remarkably trusting. This particular Hedgehog is the Storm one — the one whose sensory world and emotional world amplify each other, creating an inner weather system that can shift from calm to storm with very little warning. The spines go up not because [HE/SHE/THEY] wants them to, but because the world just got too loud, too bright, too rough, or too unfair — and the only safe response [HIS/HER/THEIR] nervous system knows is to curl inward and protect what is soft underneath.",

[NAME]'s sensory system is turned up higher than most people's. What registers as background noise for other children registers as genuine physical discomfort for [NAME]. A scratchy tag is not an inconvenience. It is a persistent, unavoidable source of pain. A sudden loud noise is not startling. It is physically distressing. The world, for [NAME], is simply louder, brighter, rougher, and more overwhelming than it is for most people — and [HE/SHE/THEY] has been navigating that gap for [HIS/HER/THEIR] entire life.\nWhat makes [NAME]'s experience particularly intense is that the sensory overload does not stay in the body. It travels directly to the emotional system. When [NAME]'s senses are overwhelmed, the emotional response is immediate, intense, and often looks completely out of proportion to whatever triggered it. A noisy classroom doesn't just make [NAME] uncomfortable — it makes [HIM/HER/THEM] irritable, tearful, or explosive, in ways that look like moodiness or defiance but are actually the emotional overflow of a sensory system that has been pushed past its limit. This is not a choice. It is not a behaviour problem. It is the way [NAME]'s nervous system processes a world that was not designed for the sensitivity [HE/SHE/THEY] was born with.",

[HE/SHE/THEY] feels things fully — joy as much as pain, connection as much as overwhelm. The empathy that comes from living in a world turned up to full volume is real, and it is rare. [NAME] doesn't need to be toughened up. [HE/SHE/THEY] needs a world that makes enough room for the depth of feeling [HE/SHE/THEY] was born with.

That physical distress immediately activates the emotional system. The emotional system responds with an intensity that matches the sensory pain — not the external event. So what looks to the outside world like an overreaction to a door slamming is actually [NAME]'s nervous system responding to genuine physical pain with a proportionate emotional response.

When you add the time pressure of a school morning, the sensory discomfort meets emotional overload and the result can be tears, refusal, or a full shutdown before the day has even started. What helps: lay out clothes the night before, ideally ones [NAME] has already approved as comfortable. Remove all labels. Choose soft fabrics and seamless socks.

By mid-morning, [NAME]'s sensory budget may already be running low. What teachers see is a child who is increasingly irritable, withdrawn, or reactive — what is actually happening is a nervous system that has been absorbing more input than it can process. What helps: if your school is receptive, ask for noise-cancelling headphones during independent work, a quiet space [NAME] can access when overwhelmed, and a five-minute heads-up before transitions like assemblies or PE.

What [NAME] needs in this moment is sensory relief — not questions about the day, not homework, not siblings being loud. What helps: create a predictable decompression routine. A quiet room, dim lighting, a favourite blanket or soft toy, maybe calm music or an audiobook. Give [NAME] 20 to 30 minutes of low-sensory time before asking anything of [HIM/HER/THEM].

On a hard day, the emotions that were held in all day finally arrive, and bedtime becomes the moment when everything surfaces — the noise that hurt, the touch that startled, the moment that felt unfair. What helps: a consistent, low-stimulation bedtime routine that [NAME] can predict completely. Dim lighting, soft pyjamas, the same sequence every night. If emotions arrive, sit with them quietly rather than trying to fix them. A simple \"That was a hard day for your body and your feelings.

Not performatively brave — genuinely, instinctively, physically brave in a way that most children are not. [HE/SHE/THEY] will try the thing no one else will try. [HE/SHE/THEY] will go first. [HE/SHE/THEY] will say the honest thing in a room full of people dancing around it. [HE/SHE/THEY] will throw [HIMSELF/HERSELF/THEMSELVES] into a new experience with total commitment and zero hesitation. This is not recklessness — it is courage that has not yet learned its own boundaries. In the right environment, with the right support, [NAME]'s fearlessness becomes leadership. [HIS/HER/THEIR] directness becomes integrity. [HIS/HER/THEIR] bias toward action becomes the ability to get things done when everyone else is still deliberating. The world does not have enough people willing to move first. [NAME] was born to be one of them.",
    "aboutBrain": "[NAME]'s profile is shaped by two areas where [HIS/HER/THEIR] brain works differently, and understanding both of them reframes what looks like recklessness as something far more neurological and far more manageable.",

        "title": "Hyperactivity and Impulsivity",
        "content": "[NAME]'s brain operates with a significantly reduced gap between impulse and action. In most children, there is a brief neurological pause between \"I want to do this\" and actually doing it — a fraction of a second where the brain checks the idea against likely outcomes. In [NAME]'s brain, that pause is either very short or effectively absent. The impulse arrives and the body follows, often simultaneously. This is not a choice. It is the way [NAME]'s inhibitory system is wired. Research on ADHD consistently shows that the brain's braking system — the prefrontal cortex's ability to interrupt an impulse before it becomes an action — develops on a different timeline in children with this profile. [NAME] is not choosing to act without thinking. [NAME]'s brain is acting before the thinking part has been consulted."
      },
      {
        "title": "Emotional Regulation",
        "content": "specifically the way emotions amplify impulses. When [NAME] is excited, the excitement fuels the impulsivity: the idea feels so good, so urgent, so alive that waiting becomes neurologically impossible. When [NAME] is frustrated, the frustration bypasses reasoning entirely and goes straight to action — a thrown object, a shoved sibling, a door slammed with full force. When [NAME] is joyful, the joy is expressed physically, loudly, and with total abandon. In every case, the emotional system is adding fuel to an engine that already has no brakes. The behaviour is not the problem. The behaviour is the symptom of two neurological systems — impulsivity and emotional intensity — working together without sufficient moderation. Understanding this changes everything about how you respond."

      "morning": "[NAME] wakes up ready to move. Within minutes of being awake [HE/SHE/THEY] has already done something at full speed — jumped off the bed, run into a sibling's room, knocked something over on the way to the kitchen. None of this is intentional disruption. [NAME]'s body is simply online before [HIS/HER/THEIR] executive brain is, and the morning is a series of impulses acted on before anyone — including [NAME] — has had time to think. Breakfast may involve a spill, a blurted statement, or a conflict with a sibling that escalated from zero to ten in under a second. What helps: reduce the number of decisions and physical obstacles in the morning. A clear, short routine (eat, dress, bag, door) with one step at a time keeps the impulses channelled. If [NAME] has physical energy to burn, a brief burst of intense movement before leaving the house (star jumps, running up and down the hallway, skipping) can take the edge off. Channel the energy rather than trying to contain it.",
      "school": "The classroom asks [NAME] to do the thing [HIS/HER/THEIR] brain finds hardest: wait. Wait to be called on. Wait for instructions to finish. Wait for [HIS/HER/THEIR] turn. Wait before starting. Every one of these waiting moments is a direct demand on the braking system that is [NAME]'s greatest area of neurological difference. [HE/SHE/THEY] will call out answers, leave [HIS/HER/THEIR] seat, touch things without permission, and start activities before the instructions are finished — not to be disruptive, but because the impulse to act is genuinely stronger than the ability to wait. What helps: if your school is receptive, ask for movement breaks built into the day, a fidget tool at [NAME]'s desk, and a private signal between [NAME] and the teacher that means \"pause and check in with me before you act.\" Seating near the teacher also helps — proximity provides the external braking that [NAME]'s internal system is still building.",
      "afterSchool": "[NAME] has spent the entire school day suppressing impulses, and when [HE/SHE/THEY] arrives home, the containment ends. The energy and the impulsivity that were held in all day release at once. This might look like running through the house, roughhousing with siblings, or an immediate emotional reaction to something minor. This is not [NAME] choosing to be difficult at home. This is a nervous system that has been holding itself together all day and has finally reached a safe space to let go. What helps: provide a physical outlet immediately. Before homework, before questions about the day, before any demands. Twenty minutes of vigorous, unstructured physical activity (trampoline, bike ride, ball games, running) gives [NAME]'s body what it has been needing all day. After the physical release, [NAME] will be significantly more regulated and capable of sitting down for calmer activities.",
      "bedtime": "Bedtime requires [NAME] to do something [HIS/HER/THEIR] brain finds deeply unnatural: transition from high energy to stillness. The impulse to keep going — one more game, one more story, one more thing — is genuine, not strategic. [NAME]'s brain does not have a natural wind-down sequence in the way that many children's brains do. What helps: a physical wind-down 30 minutes before bed (stretching, yoga, a warm bath) followed by a predictable, low-stimulation routine. Keep the steps the same every night so [NAME]'s brain begins to associate the sequence with sleep. If [NAME] is still physically restless in bed, deep pressure (a weighted blanket, firm back rub, or tight tuck-in) can help the nervous system settle. A brief bedtime check-in — \"What was the best part of today? What was the hardest?\" — gives [NAME] a contained space to process without the conversation expanding into something that re-energises [HIM/HER/THEM]."

    "overwhelm": "[NAME]'s overwhelm is fast, physical, and often alarming to the adults around [HIM/HER/THEM]. When the emotional and impulsive systems overload at the same time — a frustration that is too big, a consequence that feels too unfair, an excitement that has nowhere to go — the result is an explosion of physical energy that can look like aggression but is actually a nervous system discharging at full capacity. Thrown objects, physical outbursts, shouted words that [NAME] does not mean and will genuinely regret — all of these are the impulsive system operating without any braking at all, fuelled by an emotional intensity that has overwhelmed every moderating system [NAME] has.\nIn these moments, safety comes first. Remove anything dangerous from reach. Create physical space. Do not try to reason, lecture, or ask questions — [NAME]'s reasoning brain is offline. Lower your voice rather than raising it. If [NAME] will accept it, firm physical grounding (a tight hug, hands on shoulders, or sitting together on the floor) can help the nervous system find a baseline. If [NAME] does not want touch, simply stay close, stay calm, and wait. The storm will pass. It always does.\nAfter the overwhelm has passed, repair matters enormously. [NAME] almost certainly feels ashamed of what happened, even if [HE/SHE/THEY] cannot say so. A calm, connecting conversation — \"That was a big moment. Your body took over. That happens sometimes. Let's talk about what we can try next time\" — teaches [NAME] that the impulse is not who [HE/SHE/THEY] is, and that the relationship is not broken by the explosion. Over time, you can build a shared vocabulary: \"I can see the bull starting to charge. Do you want to take a break before it gets too big?\" This gives [NAME] an early-warning system and a dignified exit before the overwhelm takes over.",
